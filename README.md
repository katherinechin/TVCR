Utilizing smartphonesâ€™ NFC readers, The Virtual Card Reader (TVCR) collects data from identification cards embedded with NFC tags, and the data is populated into a contacts list. Our goal is to provide a simple, efficient way for professionals to exchange contact information. Examples of embedded identification cards are business cards and student identification cards.
